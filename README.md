### CircleCI Badge for goodrjk/MicroServices_Project   
[![goodrjk](https://circleci.com/gh/goodrjk/MicroServices_Project.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/goodrjk/MicroServices_Project/?branch=main)



### Project Summary

Using a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several factors, build a Docker image to allow for starting the app and obtaining house price predictions running both locally and in a Kubernetes cluster.
This requires building and testing the environment, defining and building the Docker image, uploading the new image to Docker, configuring Kubernetes and deploying the container to the cluster.
